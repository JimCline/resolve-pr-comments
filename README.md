# github-agent-plugins

**A Claude Code plugin marketplace for GitHub pull-request workflows** — built on one
architecture: a **higher-reasoning orchestrator** that reasons, decides, and talks to you,
delegating all GitHub I/O to **Haiku worker subagents** that own the GitHub MCP connection
and hand back only distilled results. Raw API payloads never enter the expensive model's
context, and the expensive model is never spent driving tools it doesn't need.

## Plugins

| Plugin | Commands | What they do |
|---|---|---|
| **[github-pr-toolkit](github-pr-toolkit/README.md)** | `/resolve-pr-comments` | Respond to and **resolve** the review comments reviewers left on your PRs — assess each thread, reply, fix or reject, resolve. |
| | `/code-critic` | **Author** an adversarial code review of a local diff or a GitHub PR across user-selected categories (general, security, design, rules-adherence, performance, tests — plus your own, via the `add-review-category` wizard skill), fanned out to parallel per-category review subagents (or the advisor / main agent, with optional advisor second opinions) — severity-triaged findings, fix locally or post inline comments as one review, deduped against existing threads. ([docs](github-pr-toolkit/docs/code-critic.md)) |
| | `/github-pr-toolkit:doctor` | Diagnose (and help fix) the GitHub MCP wiring without running either flow. |

The two flows are complements: **code-critic writes reviews; resolve-pr-comments works
through the reviews others wrote.** One plugin, one PAT config for both.

> `github-pr-toolkit` replaces the former separate `resolve-pr-comments` and
> `code-critic` plugins — uninstall those, install this, enter the PAT once.

## Install

```
/plugin marketplace add JimCline/github-agent-plugins
/plugin install github-pr-toolkit@jimcline
```

The install dialog prompts for a single **GitHub PAT** (stored in your OS keychain),
shared by both commands. Fine-grained scopes: **Metadata: Read, Pull requests: Read &
write, Contents: Read** — see the [plugin README](github-pr-toolkit/README.md#github-token-requirements).

## Requirements (common)

- **Claude Code** (recent) — plugin MCP servers, subagents, PreToolUse hooks
  (verified on v2.1.206).
- **A GitHub MCP server** — default: **GitHub's hosted remote MCP**, connected
  directly from the plugin's `.mcp.json` (PAT flows keychain → Bearer header; nothing
  to install or run locally). Local alternative: edit `.mcp.json` to run the official
  server via Docker or the native binary.
- **`gh` CLI** *(optional)* — gated fallback for servers lacking a native capability.

## Architecture (shared)

- The GitHub MCP server is defined in the plugin's `.mcp.json` (Claude Code drops
  `mcpServers` declared in plugin agent frontmatter), and a **PreToolUse guard hook**
  enforces the gate: the main agent is always denied the
  `mcp__plugin_github-pr-toolkit_github__*` tools, while the two worker subagents are
  actively granted them — delegation is mandatory, not advisory.
- Workers run on **Haiku** with a locked tool allowlist, the server narrowed to the
  pull-request toolset, and explicit never-fabricate rules; the orchestrator
  cross-checks worker returns. Haiku executes, it never judges: trimming is verbatim
  truncation (never summarization), failure sequencing in combined tasks is pinned, and
  the `gh` CLI is a **gated** fallback — allowed only after the MCP call for the same
  operation failed, and flagged in the return (`via: gh (mcp error: …)`) so a broken
  MCP setup can't hide behind it.
- **Dispatch economy:** workers take batched/combined tasks with exception-only,
  exact-string returns (`ok: <N> …`, verified against the count sent), so a full flow
  costs ~3 worker dispatches instead of one per thread/finding — each avoided dispatch
  saves fixed harness overhead plus anything ambient hooks inject into subagent prompts.
- code-critic adds a session-scoped **PreToolUse guard** for the `gh`/git surface during
  an active review.
- code-critic's adversarial pass can fan out to **six per-category review subagents**
  (`code-reviewer-*`, running on the session model, not Haiku); the guard hook grants
  them read-only inspection Bash ONLY, so the static-review rule is enforced by
  construction. Their findings are cross-checked against the orchestrator's own diff.

See the [plugin README](github-pr-toolkit/README.md) for setup, flows, security notes,
and troubleshooting.
