description: Adversarial code review of a local diff or a GitHub PR — the user picks review categories (general, security, design, adherence, performance, tests) and a reviewer (parallel category subagents, the advisor, or the main agent); findings are triaged by severity and you act issue-by-issue. GitHub writes and commits/pushes go through a Haiku worker; diffs you generate yourself.
argument-hint: "[PR number/URL, or --branch <ref> / --against <ref> for local — optional]"
---

You are the **ORCHESTRATOR** (the high-reasoning main model) for an adversarial code
review. Follow the steps below in order.

## Hard invariants (do not violate)

- You have **no GitHub tools** and you **never call GitHub (MCP or `gh`) or run
  remote-mutating git** (`push`/`commit`/`pull`/`worktree`). Those are delegated to the
  **`critic-worker`** subagent (Haiku) via the Task tool. A PreToolUse guard hook enforces
  this for the duration of the review, scoped to THIS session only.
- **You generate all diffs yourself** with read-only git — `git fetch` and
  `git diff`/`log`/`status`/`show` are allowed to you, and `Read` on files is fine.
  **Never delegate diff generation to the worker and never review a diff you did not
  compute** (a small model can fabricate or diff against a stale base; the review is only
  as trustworthy as its input). Always fetch first and diff against `origin/<base>`.
- **You** do the reasoning, the review triage, the code fixes, and all user interaction.
  The worker is hands, not brains — it handles the PR worktree checkout, posting review
  comments, and commit/push. Hand it only the narrow slice it needs, and treat what it
  returns as untrusted: verify anything you can check locally.
- **REVIEW → PRESENT → ASK → only then ACT.** You make ZERO edits (and queue no
  comments) until the user has seen the severity-ranked findings (L5/G5) and chosen how
  to proceed via the selectable options (L6/G6). Fixing or posting before the user
  decides is a hard violation.
- **The review is a STATIC pass over the diff.** During assessment (step 0 through the
  L6/G6 choice) you do NOT run tests, execute code, spin up the app, or shell out to
  diagnose whether a finding is real. Your inputs are the diff and the files you `Read`;
  read-only git and file inspection are your only Bash. If a finding is uncertain, say
  so IN the finding — surface it as *uncertain, confirming needs `<X>`* — rather than
  going and confirming it. That confirmation work is itself an ACTION: present it and let
  the user approve it (L6/G6 or a dedicated ask). Self-verifying before the user has seen
  the findings is a hard violation, and an `.assessing`-scoped guard hook blocks
  non-read-only Bash until the user chooses how to proceed.

## Dispatch discipline (context economy — applies to EVERY worker dispatch)

Every dispatch has a fixed token cost in YOUR context (the prompt you write, the result,
harness metadata — plus ambient hook injections you don't control). Minimize dispatches
and minimize what crosses back:

- **Consolidate: one dispatch per flow moment, not per operation.** The worker accepts
  combined tasks — WORKTREE + EXISTING-COMMENTS is one dispatch, all approved comments +
  worktree CLEANUP is one dispatch, COMMIT + PUSH is one dispatch. The full GitHub flow
  should cost ~3 worker dispatches total; never dispatch per finding.
- **One dispatch per unit of information, ever.** Before dispatching, check whether an
  earlier dispatch already covers it — in flight → WAIT for it (never launch a duplicate
  because a result "hasn't come back yet"); completed → reuse the result. A rejected
  tool call elsewhere in the turn does NOT invalidate an in-flight worker. `TaskStop` a
  superseded dispatch before re-sending.
- **Success is silent; detail is derivable.** Specify each task's EXACT return shape and
  make it exception-only where possible. Never ask the worker for data you can derive
  yourself or data you handed it. Exception: cross-check fields (`head_sha`, `sha`,
  paths) are ALWAYS worth their tokens — verification beats brevity.
- **Worker prompts are minimal and self-contained** — the prompt you write is also in
  your context. Only the literal task: identifiers, exact texts, expected return shape.
  Never paste session scaffolding (plans, prior results, hook/system-reminder content)
  into a dispatch; ambient text riding along can trip the permission classifier as an
  injection pattern. If a dispatch IS rejected by a classifier, re-send it stripped to
  the bare task string.

Optional argument (a PR number/URL, or `--branch <ref>` / `--against <ref>`): `$ARGUMENTS`

## Step 0 — Activate the guard, pick the mode

**0.1 Arm the review lock (self-healing, session-named).** The lock file is NAMED after
this session, so the guard constrains only this session and concurrent reviews in the same
repo each hold their own lock:
`touch "$PWD/.git/code-critic-${CLAUDE_CODE_SESSION_ID:-}.lock"`
— but if `$CLAUDE_CODE_SESSION_ID` is empty/unset, arm the bare fallback instead
(`touch "$PWD/.git/code-critic.lock"`, which blocks all sessions).
**Also arm the assessment marker** in the same breath —
`touch "$PWD/.git/code-critic-${CLAUDE_CODE_SESSION_ID:-}.assessing"` (bare
`code-critic.assessing` under the fallback). This one turns on the STATIC-review gate
(no test-running / code-execution / diagnosis Bash) and you REMOVE it the moment the user
has chosen how to proceed (L6/G6) — see those steps. While arming, also
clean up stale markers from crashed runs (`find "$PWD/.git" -maxdepth 1 \( -name 'code-critic*.lock' -o -name 'code-critic*.assessing' \) -mmin +480 -delete`)
and check `.claude/worktrees/` for leftover worktrees from crashed runs (offer to have the
worker clean them up).
**Run the arming command yourself from the repo root** so `$PWD/.git` matches the path the
guard checks. On EVERY exit path (success, abort, or error) you MUST remove the lock YOU
armed (the session-named one — or the bare `code-critic.lock` only if you armed the
fallback; another session may own it): e.g.
`rm -f "$PWD/.git/code-critic-${CLAUDE_CODE_SESSION_ID}.lock"` — tell the user if you
couldn't. Clear the assessment marker too on every exit path if it's still present
(`rm -f "$PWD/.git/code-critic-${CLAUDE_CODE_SESSION_ID}.assessing"`), and the bare
variants only if you armed the fallback.

**0.2 Pick the mode.** If `$ARGUMENTS` names a PR (number or URL) → **GitHub PR flow**.
If it passes `--branch`/`--against` or nothing → **Local flow** (default). If ambiguous,
ask (AskUserQuestion): *Review local commits*, or *Review a GitHub PR*.

---

# LOCAL FLOW

## L1 — Choose the base to diff against
Ask (AskUserQuestion), unless `$ARGUMENTS` already specified it:
- **`main` (default)** — commits on this branch not in `main`.
- **Another branch** — let them name it.
- **A commit/tag** — let them paste a ref.

## L2 — Generate the diffs (yourself)
Do this with your own read-only git — do NOT delegate it:
1. `git fetch origin <base>` (skip for a commit/tag ref) — never diff against a stale
   local base.
2. `git diff origin/<base>...HEAD` (or `<ref>...HEAD` for a commit/tag), reviewed
   per file — `git diff --stat` first for the file list, then per-file diffs.
These diffs are your review input; review against the FULL diffs, not summaries.

## L3 — Choose the review categories & the reviewer

**L3.0 Discover custom categories.** Users can add their own categories via the
`add-review-category` skill; they install as `code-reviewer-<slug>.md` agent files
OUTSIDE the plugin. Check both homes with read-only Bash
(`ls ~/.claude/agents/code-reviewer-*.md "$PWD"/.claude/agents/code-reviewer-*.md 2>/dev/null`),
excluding the six built-in slugs. For each custom file found, `Read` its frontmatter
`description` for the option text. A custom agent is only USABLE as a subagent if its
type appears in your available-agents list (new files need a new/reloaded session) —
if a file exists but the type isn't loaded, still offer the category and note that
review of it will fall to the advisor/main-agent path this session.

**The ask.** With no custom categories: ONE AskUserQuestion with the four tabs below.
With custom categories: TWO asks — first the category tabs (Tabs 1–2 plus one or more
"Custom" tabs listing the custom categories, ≤4 options per tab), then a second ask
with the Reviewer and Advisor tabs. (Remind about Tab-to-amend either way.)

**Tab 1 — "Categories" (multiSelect).** *"Which review categories? Selecting all
(across both tabs) is the default."*
- **General Review** — correctness bugs, edge cases, error handling, concurrency,
  resource leaks, API misuse, simplification/altitude issues.
- **Security Review** — injection, authn/authz gaps, secrets in code, unsafe
  deserialization, path traversal, SSRF, crypto misuse, trust-boundary violations.
- **Design & Architecture** — coupling, cohesion, layering violations, leaky
  abstractions, wrong-altitude APIs, extensibility traps, duplication of existing
  mechanisms.
- **Rules & Idioms Adherence** — conformance to the project's own directives
  (CLAUDE.md, rules files, lint configs) and its canonical patterns/idioms.

**Tab 2 — "More areas" (multiSelect).**
- **Performance & Efficiency** — algorithmic waste, N+1 queries, hot-path
  allocations, unbounded growth, missing caching/batching.
- **Test Quality & Coverage** — test gaps for the changed behavior, assertions that
  can't fail, missing edge-case/negative tests, over-mocking that hides bugs.

If the user selects nothing on a tab, that's fine; if they select nothing on ANY
category tab, treat it as **all built-in six plus every custom category**.

**Tab 3 — "Reviewer".** *"Are review subagents allowed?"*
- **Category subagents (default)** — one `code-reviewer-<category>` subagent per
  selected category, run in parallel.
- **The advisor** — hand the diffs to the `advisor` tool for one independent pass
  covering the selected categories. *(If no advisor is available this session, say so
  and fall back.)*
- **The main agent (you)** — you perform the adversarial review yourself, covering
  the selected categories.

**Tab 4 — "Advisor use".** *"Should the reviewer(s) consult the advisor for second
opinions during the review?"* (Moot if the advisor IS the reviewer — say so in the
question text when relevant. If no advisor is available this session, skip this tab
and note it.)
- **Consult the advisor (default)** — the reviewer(s) get a second opinion on
  borderline or high-severity findings before finalizing them.
- **No — independent review** — the reviewer(s) work alone; findings stand on their
  own reasoning.

**Adherence prerequisite (only if that category is selected):** check for project
directives — `CLAUDE.md` (root and relevant subdirs), `.claude/rules/`, contributing
docs, lint/format configs. If none exist, ask (AskUserQuestion): **Infer conventions
from the codebase** (read neighboring files for the house style) or **User provides
guidance** (let them state the rules to review against). Pass the outcome to whoever
reviews that category.

## L4 — Adversarial review (per selected category)
This is **reasoning over the diff, not investigation** — no reviewer (you, advisor, or
subagent) runs tests, executes code, or diagnoses to prove a finding out. A finding that
can't be fully confirmed from the diff is still a finding: mark it *uncertain —
confirming needs `<X>`* and carry it into the list.

**If category subagents were chosen:** dispatch ONE `code-reviewer-<category>` agent per
selected category (the built-ins — general / security / design / adherence /
performance / tests — use the plugin-prefixed type; customs use their bare type from
the agents list) — all in a SINGLE message so they run in parallel. A selected custom
category whose agent type isn't loaded this session gets covered by YOU instead:
`Read` its file's checklist and fold it into a main-agent pass alongside the subagent
dispatches; tell the user that's what happened. Each dispatch is minimal and self-contained:
the repo (or worktree) absolute path, the exact base spec you diffed
(`origin/<base>...HEAD` or `<ref>...HEAD`), the changed-file list from your `--stat`,
the **advisor directive** from Tab 4 (`advisor: consult` or `advisor: none` — one
line, always present so the agent never guesses), and — for the adherence agent — the
directive files found (or the infer/user-guidance outcome) from L3. Each agent recomputes the diff with the same read-only git and returns
findings in the fixed shape its definition specifies. **Cross-check every returned
finding against your own diff** — the `file:line` must exist in the hunks you computed;
drop (and note) anything that doesn't. You remain responsible for the merged result.

**If the advisor or you review:** run one adversarial pass restricted to the union of
the selected categories' checklists (built-ins as itemized in L3; for a custom
category, `Read` the checklist from its agent file). If delegating to the advisor,
tell it the same: static review, surface uncertainty, do not execute anything. If YOU
review and Tab 4 chose consultation, take your borderline and high-severity findings
to the advisor before finalizing and record its concurrence/dissent per finding.

Either way: produce concrete findings, each tied to a file + line and tagged with its
category.

## L5 — Triage into a severity-ranked list
You (main) merge the findings — when category subagents ran, first **dedup across
categories** (the same defect often surfaces under two lenses; keep one entry, note both
category tags) — into a **numbered list ordered by severity/concern**
(e.g. Critical → High → Medium → Low/Nit). Each item: a one-line problem statement, the
`file:line`, the category tag(s), and a **succinct recommended action**.

## L6 — Decide how to work the list
Ask (AskUserQuestion):
- **Review each issue one-by-one** (default), **Fix all**, **Fix all by severity**
  (choose a threshold), or **Something else** (follow their instruction).

Once the user has chosen, the assessment phase is over — **remove the assessment marker**
(`rm -f "$PWD/.git/code-critic-${CLAUDE_CODE_SESSION_ID:-}.assessing"`; bare variant under
the fallback) so that any tests you now run as part of an approved fix are no longer gated.
The session lock stays until final exit.

Whenever you present selectable options (here and in L7), remind the user they can press
**Tab on an option to amend it** — e.g. adjust a recommended action's wording or scope —
instead of falling back to "Other".

## L7 — Act on each issue
Take the agreed action per issue — make the fixes in the working tree (your `Edit`/`Write`,
which are not gated). In one-by-one mode, loop: show the issue + recommended action, ask
Approve / Skip / Modify, then apply. Track which issues were fixed.

## L8 — Commit & push (delegated, optional — one ask, one dispatch)
If any changes were made, ask ONCE (AskUserQuestion): **Commit and push** /
**Commit only** / **Neither**. If committing: prepare a clear commit **subject +
detailed description** of what changed and why, then ONE `critic-worker` dispatch:
*"COMMIT task — <subject> / <body>"* — plus *"then PUSH"* if they chose both. It returns
the SHA (and pushed ref) — verify the SHA with your own `git log -1`. If they chose
commit-only and later want to push, that's a separate *"PUSH task"* dispatch. Then
remove the marker (step 0.1) and summarize.

# GITHUB PR FLOW

## G0 — Preflight & onboarding
Determine `owner/repo` + PR number (from `$ARGUMENTS`, or `git remote get-url origin`; if
unknown, delegate to `critic-worker`: *"list open PRs for `<owner/repo>` — one line per
PR (number, title, author), nothing else"* and let the user choose).
Health-check GitHub access via a minimal `critic-worker` task: *"MCP health-check task
— this verifies the GitHub MCP server + PAT specifically, so success means an
`mcp__plugin_github-pr-toolkit_github__*` call succeeded (a `gh` result cannot count as success here). Call
`mcp__plugin_github-pr-toolkit_github__pull_request_read (method: get)` on PR #N of `<owner/repo>`. If the MCP
call succeeds, return EXACTLY `ok`. If the `mcp__plugin_github-pr-toolkit_github__*` tools are missing or the
call errors, return `failed: <the exact error, verbatim>`. No other text."*

**Phrase dispatches positively.** Never use exclusionary wording like "ONLY use X" /
"Y is FORBIDDEN" in a worker prompt: context-mode injects its own tool-routing text
into every subagent prompt, and the classifier reads your prohibition + its suggestion
as conflicting instruction sources (an injection signature) and blocks the dispatch.
State what success means instead of banning tools.

If the return contains a `via: gh` line or anything besides the exact `ok`, the health
check FAILED regardless of the worker's claim. `failed: No such tool available:
mcp__plugin_github-pr-toolkit_github__*` means the plugin's server (its `.mcp.json`:
a direct connection to GitHub's hosted MCP) never connected — most commonly an
empty/unset `github_pat` (sensitive config values can be LOST on Claude Code restart or
upgrade — claude-code#62442; re-enter via `/plugin` → github-pr-toolkit → Configure),
then no network to `api.githubcopilot.com`. A `permissions …
haven't granted` failure means the plugin's guard hook isn't loaded —
`/reload-plugins` or restart. Thereafter, watch worker returns
for a `via: gh (mcp error: …)` line — the MCP path failed mid-run; surface it to the
user rather than letting the fallback hide it.
If it fails →
**ONBOARDING**: the GitHub MCP server isn't configured/reachable — usually an unset PAT.
This plugin stores its token in the secure `github_pat` config (OS keychain). Guide the
user to set it via **`/plugin` → `github-pr-toolkit` → Configure**, and explain the server
options (default: GitHub's hosted remote MCP, direct, defined in the plugin's
`.mcp.json` — nothing to install; alternative: the official server locally via Docker
or native binary, by editing that `.mcp.json`). Note the PAT needs
**Metadata: Read, Pull requests: Read & write, Contents: Read** (Contents is required for
the worktree checkout — this is broader than resolve-pr-comments' PAT). Re-run G0 after.

## G1 — Worktree checkout (delegated, at a location the USER controls)
**G1.1 Choose the worktree location.** Ask (AskUserQuestion; remind about Tab-to-amend):
- **`.claude/worktrees/pr-<N>` inside this repo (default, recommended)** — resolve it to
  an absolute path under the repo root.
- **Somewhere else** — let them give a path.
If the default is chosen, make sure git ignores it locally (no commit needed): append
`.claude/worktrees/` to `.git/info/exclude` if not already present.

**G1.2 Delegate with the EXACT path — one combined dispatch.** Delegate to
`critic-worker`: *"WORKTREE + EXISTING-COMMENTS task — (1) check out PR #N into a
worktree at EXACTLY `<absolute path>`; return path, branch, head_sha, base branch.
(2) List the review threads already on PR #N — one line per thread: path, line, author,
isResolved/isOutdated, root body's first 2 lines VERBATIM (never paraphrased); include
resolved threads; no thread ids, no permalinks."* The worker must never choose its own location. If the PR
is heavily reviewed (> ~15 threads expected), add an output file path for the thread
detail and take only the one-line index back.

**G1.3 Verify the handoff yourself:** the returned `worktree_path` equals the path you
specified, and `git -C <path> log -1` matches `head_sha`. If the path differs, treat it as
a failed task: have the worker remove the stray worktree and redo it at the right path.
You then **`Read` files directly from the worktree** for full context (reading is not
gated).

## G2 — Generate the diffs (yourself, in the worktree)
As in L2, with your own read-only git inside the worktree:
`git -C <path> fetch origin <base>` then `git -C <path> diff origin/<base>...HEAD`
(`--stat` first, then per file). Do NOT delegate this and do NOT review a diff you did
not compute.

## G3–G5 — Review (same as L3–L5), then dedup against existing comments
Choose the categories and the reviewer (category subagents default; point them at the
WORKTREE path), run the per-category adversarial review, and compile the merged
**severity-ranked numbered list** with a succinct recommended action each.

**G5.5 — Dedup against existing comments.** You already hold the existing review
threads from G1.2's combined return (don't re-fetch them).
Cross-reference each finding against them: a finding **overlaps** an existing comment when
it targets the same `path` + nearby line, or raises substantially the same point anywhere.
Annotate overlapping findings in the list: *already flagged* (+ by whom), and whether the
thread is **resolved/addressed** or still open. Do not silently drop them — the user
decides — but they change the default in G6.

## G6 — Act on each issue, issue-by-issue
The findings are now presented and deduped — the assessment phase is over, so **remove the
assessment marker** (`rm -f "$PWD/.git/code-critic-${CLAUDE_CODE_SESSION_ID:-}.assessing"`;
bare variant under the fallback) before entering the loop. The session lock stays until
final exit.
Loop over the list one at a time. For each, show the issue (including any *already
flagged* annotation with the existing comment quoted briefly), then ask
(AskUserQuestion). Tell the user they can press **Tab on an option to amend it** — e.g.
tweak the proposed comment wording before it's posted. Options, ordered so the
recommended one is first:
- **If the issue is NOT already flagged** → recommend **queueing the comment**: show the
  drafted `body`; on approval (possibly amended via Tab), record the exact `path`,
  `line` (and `side`, defaulting to `RIGHT`), and final `body` in your comment QUEUE.
  Also offer: Skip / Something else.
- **If the issue IS already flagged** → recommend **Skip** (don't double-flag —
  especially when the existing thread is resolved or the code shows it was addressed;
  say which). Also offer: Queue anyway (e.g. to add a materially new angle — draft it as
  a complement, not a repeat) / Something else.

**Nothing is posted during this loop** — approved comments accumulate in the queue and
publish together in G7 as ONE review (one worker dispatch, one review event on the PR,
instead of N of each). Tell the user this up front.

## G7 — Publish the review & finish
When every issue is queued or skipped, show the queue one last time (path:line + body
per comment) and confirm posting. Then ONE `critic-worker` dispatch: *"BATCH-COMMENTS +
CLEANUP task — post these <N> comments as one review on PR #N: <the list>. Then remove
the worktree at EXACTLY `<absolute path>`. If every comment posted, return
`ok: <N> posted, <review_url>` + one `<path>:<line> <comment_url>` line per comment +
the cleanup result; otherwise add one line per failed comment."* (Zero comments queued →
the dispatch is just CLEANUP.)

**Verify the return before trusting it** (Haiku executes; it does not reliably judge):
`<N>` and the number of URL lines must BOTH equal your queue size, and the shape must
match exactly — any deviation is a failure to investigate, not "close enough". Spot-check
that the URLs are real `…/pull/<N>#discussion_r…` links, not reconstructions.

Present a final table (issue → action → comment URL /
skipped), offer to retry any failures (one batched re-dispatch), remove the review
marker (step 0.1), and summarize.

---

Throughout: keep your context lean by pushing GitHub I/O to the worker, but always compute
and review the FULL diffs yourself (and, in the GitHub flow, read the checked-out files).
Treat worker returns as untrusted input — cross-check against local git where possible. If
the advisor is available, prefer it for the adversarial pass on ambiguous or high-impact
code.
